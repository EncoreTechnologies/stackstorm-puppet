      This action renders one or more EPP templates.

      The command accepts one or more templates (.epp files), given the same way as
      templates are given to the puppet epp function (a full path, or a relative reference
      on the form 'modulename/template-name.epp'), or as a relative path.args In case the
      given path matches both a modulename/template and a file, the template from the module
      is used.
      
      If multiple templates are given, the same set of values are given to each template.
      If both --values and --value_file are used, the --values are merged on top of those
      given in the file.

      When multiple templates are rendered, a separating header is output between the templates
      showing the name of the template before the output. The header output can be turned off
      with --no-header. This also concatenates the template results without any added newline
      separators.
